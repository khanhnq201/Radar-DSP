# Indoor MIMO Radar Signal Processing
# Overview
This repository contains code and data for an algorithm that mitigates multipath interference in indoor MIMO radar systems to improve signal quality. The algorithm utilizes DBSCAN and K-means clustering algorithms to identify and reduce noise sources caused by multipath signal propagation. This process results in enhanced signal clarity, which could potentially contribute to future research in human posture recognition using radar technology.
